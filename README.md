<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

**1. Ticket Intake**

What I Did:

At the start of the process, I reviewed the details of the ticket submitted by the end user. My role was to ensure all necessary information was included and to prepare the ticket for further action.
<p>
This is the dashboard where I received the ticket.

**2. Ticket Assignment**

What I Did:

I assigned the ticket to the appropriate agent or team based on its priority and nature. This step was crucial in making sure the ticket was routed correctly for resolution.
<p>
This is where I observed the ticket, updated the status to working and assigned a priority. In this case since the user couldn't log in to her PC this is considered a high priority issue that needs attention quick.

**3. Adding Comments, Updates and Resolution**

What I Did:

As I worked on the ticket, I added comments and updates to document my progress. I used this step to keep all stakeholders informed and to communicate any necessary details to the end user.
<p>
After troubleshooting and resolving the issue, I marked the ticket as "Closed." I made sure to provide a clear and detailed resolution summary in the comments so the end user knew the issue was resolved.
